## 1. Get a Domain Name

By default, GitHub provides a free domain in the form of `your-username.github.io`, but let's be honest, itâ€™s not the best-looking URL. To get a cooler domain name, you have a couple of options:

- **Purchase a domain:** I bought mine from Hostinger for just $1, but there are many domain providers out there.
- **Free domain:** You can get a free domain from [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/). They offer top-level domains (TLDs) like `.tk`, which works great for personal portfolios. Choose a domain name that reflects your brand, ideally including your name.

## 2. Build Your Portfolio

Next, develop your portfolio website. You can either:
- Download a portfolio template from the web and customize it.
- Or, if you want more control, create the entire website from scratch.

Whichever method you choose, make sure your portfolio showcases your work well!

## 3. Manage the Custom Domain

<Figcaption src={img1} alt="Example of cname-file">To link your custom domain to GitHub Pages, you need to create a `CNAME` file in the root of your repository. This file should contain only your custom domain name, like `yourdomain.com`.</Figcaption>

<Figcaption src={img2} alt="Example of DNS section">Next, log in to your domain provider's dashboard (e.g., Hostinger, Freenom, GoDaddy) and look for the DNS settings.</Figcaption>
Youâ€™ll need to add the following IP addresses as **A** records for GitHub Pages:

```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

## 4. Publish Your Portfolio

Now that your domain and website are ready, it's time to deploy:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push your portfolio's code to this repository.

And voilÃ ! Your site is now live on your custom domain ðŸŽ‰.

**Final Thoughts**

This method is ideal for hosting static websites like portfolios. It's a quick and affordable way to get your site online with a professional-looking domain. Keep in mind, though, that GitHub Pages doesn't support back-end features like PHP. But for static sites, it's perfect!
