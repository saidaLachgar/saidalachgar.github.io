## Select Elements with `pointer-events:none`

Sometimes, you may need to select elements that have the `pointer-events:none` CSS property. 

To do this, hold down the **Shift** key while hovering over the elements. This allows you to select them even if they are not normally clickable. 
<FigBrowser 
    firefox-src={select-pointer-events} 
    chrome-src={select-pointer-events} 
    safari-src={select-pointer-events} 
    edge-src={select-pointer-events} 
    alt="Select elements with pointer-events:none"
/>
<button>Demo button</button>

## Simulate Pseudo CSS Classes

Testing CSS pseudo-classes like `:hover` or `:active` can be tricky because you can't always use your mouse. In DevTools, you can easily simulate these states without any hassle. Simply inspect the element and click the **:hov** button to enable the desired pseudo-class.

<FigBrowser 
    firefox-src={select-pointer-events} 
    chrome-src={select-pointer-events} 
    safari-src={select-pointer-events} 
    edge-src={select-pointer-events} 
    alt="Use the :hov button to simulate pseudo-classes in DevTools"
/>
<button>Demo button</button>

To debug JavaScript events like `mouseover` and `mouseout`. Check out [this tutorial](/blog/debugging-javascript-events-in-browser-dev-tools).

## Zoom the DevTools UI

<Figcaption src={zoom-devtools-ui} alt="Zoom DevTools UI">If you find the DevTools interface too small, you can zoom in or out. Click inside the DevTools and use `Ctrl` + `+` to zoom in or `Ctrl` + `-` to zoom out and `Ctrl` + `0` to reset (use `Cmd` on a Mac).</Figcaption>

## Find and Export CSS Changes

After modifying CSS in DevTools, you can save your changes. In Firefox, use the **Changes** panel to copy all edits. In Chrome and Edge, access the **Changes** panel from the command menu by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`.
<FigBrowser 
    firefox-src={select-pointer-events} 
    chrome-src={select-pointer-events} 
    safari-src={select-pointer-events} 
    edge-src={select-pointer-events} 
    alt="Use the Changes panel to copy your CSS modifications"
/>

## Test Slower Network Speeds

It's important to see how your site performs on slower connections. In the **Network** panel, select a throttling option from the dropdown to simulate a slow network speed. This helps you understand how users with slower connections experience your site for both api and <span title="Like google's LCP, FCP, CLS...">SEO score</span>.
<FigBrowser 
    firefox-src={select-pointer-events} 
    chrome-src={select-pointer-events} 
    safari-src={select-pointer-events} 
    edge-src={select-pointer-events} 
    alt="Simulate slower network speeds to test your site’s performance"
/>

## Expand DOM Nodes Recursively

<Figcaption src={expand-dom-nodes} alt="Expand DOM nodes recursively">To save time while navigating the DOM tree, you can expand all child nodes of a selected element at once. Right-click on the node and choose **Expand Recursively** (in Chrome and Edge) or **Expand All** (in Firefox and Safari).</Figcaption>

## Search by Selector
<Figcaption src={search-by-selector} alt="Search by selector">Use the search bar in the Inspector to find elements by their CSS selectors.</Figcaption>

## Jump from Label to Input
