title: "How to Handle a Hotfix Using Git Fork"
summary: This guide walks you through managing a hotfix in Git using the Git Fork GUI. A hotfix is an urgent update made to fix bugs in the production codebase. We’ll use a Gitflow-inspired process to handle the hotfix efficiently without touching the command line.

## Why Use a Hotfix?

Hotfix branches allow you to quickly fix critical issues in production while keeping your main development flow uninterrupted. Once the fix is implemented, it’s merged back into both the `master` and `develop` branches, ensuring the patch is included in future development work.

## Step 1: Check Your Branches

First, make sure you’re on the correct branch before starting the hotfix.

<Figcaption src={step1} alt="branch-overview">Open the **Branches** pane in Git Fork to view your branches. The branch with a checkmark is your current branch.</Figcaption>

Ensure you’re on the `master` branch since hotfixes are based off of the production code.

## Step 2: Create the Hotfix Branch

Next, you need to create a new branch specifically for your hotfix.

<Figcaption src={step2} alt="create-hotfix-branch">Right-click on `master` and select **Create new branch**. Name the branch `hotfix/x.x.x` (where `x.x.x` is your version number, like `1.0.1`).</Figcaption>

The new hotfix branch is now created and checked out, ready for you to apply your changes.

## Step 3: Push the Hotfix Branch

Once you’ve made your changes locally, it’s time to push the new branch to the remote repository.

<Figcaption src={step3} alt="push-hotfix-branch">Click the **Push** button in the toolbar and ensure your new `hotfix/x.x.x` branch is selected.</Figcaption>

Git Fork will now push your hotfix branch to the remote repository.

## Step 4: Merge the Hotfix Into Master

With the hotfix branch ready, it’s time to merge it back into `master` to apply the fix to production.

<Figcaption src={step4} alt="merge-hotfix-to-master">Right-click on `master` and select **Merge**. Choose your `hotfix/x.x.x` branch from the list, ensuring the merge option is set to **--no-ff** (no fast-forward).</Figcaption>

This merge applies the hotfix to the production branch while keeping the history intact.

## Step 5: Tag the Hotfix

Next, you’ll want to tag this new release version for future reference.

<Figcaption src={step5} alt="create-tag-for-hotfix">Right-click on the latest commit and select **Create tag**. Name it according to your release version, e.g., `1.0.1`.</Figcaption>

This will create a versioned tag in Git that marks the hotfix in your history.

## Step 6: Verify the Tag

Now, ensure that your tag has been successfully created.

<Figcaption src={step6} alt="verify-tag">Click on the **Tags** tab in the Git Fork interface. You should see your newly created tag `1.0.1` listed there.</Figcaption>

## Step 7: Push Master and Tags to Remote

After merging and tagging, you’ll need to push these changes to the remote repository.

<Figcaption src={step7} alt="push-master-and-tags">Click **Push** again, and make sure to push both `master` and the new tag to the remote.</Figcaption>

Git Fork will sync your local changes to the remote repository, ensuring everything is up to date.

## Step 8: Merge Hotfix Into Develop

To keep your `develop` branch up to date, merge the hotfix into it as well.

<Figcaption src={step8} alt="merge-hotfix-to-develop">Switch to `develop` and right-click to **Merge** the `hotfix/x.x.x` branch.</Figcaption>

Push the updated `develop` branch to the remote repository once the merge is complete.

## Step 9: Clean Up the Hotfix Branch

Now that your hotfix has been applied and merged into both `master` and `develop`, it’s safe to remove the branch.

<Figcaption src={step9} alt="cleanup-hotfix-branch">Right-click on the `hotfix/x.x.x` branch and select **Delete** to remove it from the local repo, then push the deletion to the remote repository.</Figcaption>

---
**Done!**

You’ve successfully handled a hotfix using Git Fork, ensuring the fix is applied to both production and development branches.
