title: "How to Handle a Hotfix Using Git Fork"
summary: This guide walks you through managing a hotfix in Git using the Git Fork GUI. A hotfix is an urgent update made to fix bugs in the production codebase. We’ll use a Gitflow-inspired process to handle the hotfix efficiently without touching the command line.

## Why Use a Hotfix?

Hotfix branches allow you to quickly fix critical issues in production while keeping your main development flow uninterrupted. Once the fix is implemented, it’s merged back into both the `master` and `develop` branches, ensuring the patch is included in future development work.

## Step 1: Check Your Branches

First, make sure you’re on the correct branch before starting the hotfix.

<Figcaption src={asset_1} alt="branches-overview">In the **Branches** pane in Git Fork, the branch with a checkmark is your current branch.</Figcaption>

Ensure you’re on the `master` branch since hotfixes are based off of the production code.

## Step 2: Create the Hotfix Branch

Next, you need to create a new branch specifically for your hotfix.

<Figcaption src={asset_2} alt="create-hotfix-branch">Right-click on `master` and select **New branch..**. Name the branch `hotfix/x.x.x`.</Figcaption>

where `x.x.x` is your version number, eg : `1.4.1`

<br /><br />

## Step 3: Push the Hotfix Branch

<Figcaption src={asset_3} alt="push-hotfix-branch">Once you’ve made your changes locally, it’s time to commit and push the new branch to the remote repository.</Figcaption>

_If you have a `CHANGELOG.md` file, make sure to update it with the new app version and changes made._

## Step 4: Merge the Hotfix Into Master

With the hotfix branch ready, it’s time to merge it into `master` to apply the fix to production.

<Figcaption src={asset_4} alt="merge-hotfix-to-master">Click twice on `master` to check out then right-click on `hotfix/x.x.x` and select **Merge into 'master'...**, ensuring the merge option is set to **--no-ff** (no fast-forward).</Figcaption>

This will create a new commit on `master` with the message `Merge branch 'hotfix/x.x.x'`, you can then click **Push**.

## Step 5: Clean Up

<Figcaption src={asset_5} alt="git-history-before">Once you’ve pushed `master`, the history may look messy like this:</Figcaption> 

Let’s clean it up!

### Delete Hotfix Branch

Now that your hotfix has been applied and merged into `master`, it’s safe to remove the branch.

<Figcaption src={asset_6} alt="delete-hotfix-branch">Click on the branch, then click **Delete 'hotfix/x.x.x'...**.</Figcaption> 

Ensure you check the option **Also delete remote branch 'origin/hotfix/x.x.x'** in the popup.

### Rebase `develop`

To keep your `develop` branch up to date, rebase it onto `master`. For more details on rebasing, check out [this tutorial](/blog/why-rebase-instead-of-merge-step-by-step-guide).

<Figcaption src={asset_7} alt="git-history-before-after">After the rebase, the Git history will look cleaner like this:</Figcaption> 

<br /><br />

## Step 6: Tag the Hotfix

Next, you’ll want to tag this new release version for future reference.

Right-click on the latest commit in `master` and select **New tag...**.

<Figcaption src={asset_8} alt="create-tag-for-hotfix">Name it according to your release version, e.g., `1.4.1`, ensure **Push** is checked, and click on **Create and push**.</Figcaption>

<Figcaption src={asset_9} alt="tag-overview-in-history">This will create a versioned tag in Git that marks the hotfix in your history.</Figcaption>

**Done!**

You’ve successfully handled a hotfix using Git Fork, ensuring the fix is applied to both production and development branches.
