## Step 1: Visualize Your Grid

Let’s say you wanna select first column in a grid, start by naming each cell with it position.
Then take the desired sequence, in this case is 1, 4, 7, 10

## Step 2: Derive the Formula

Now to identify this sequance go to [Mathway](mathway.com) website and enter the sequence. When prompted, select "Identify the sequence."

Mathway will respond with:

> Use the formula an=a1+d(n−1), to identify the arithmetic sequence: an​=3n−2

## Step 3: Use the CSS Selector

Apply your formula in CSS
```CSS
ul > li:nth-child(3n-2) {
    /* Your styles here */
}
```

**That's it!**
Customizing the nth-child selector is similar to the concept of selecting odd and even elements, but with more flexibility. In this example, we focused on the first column, but you can create various sequences. For instance, you can skip two cells in a grid or choose any pattern you need for your design!
