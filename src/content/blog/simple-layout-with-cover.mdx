This is a simple layout with a cover image. The cover image is set in the front matter of the markdown file.

To set a cover image, add the `cover` key to the front matter of the markdown file. The value of the `cover` key should be the path to the image file. The path should be relative to the `src` directory.

Additionally, you can use '@' to refer to the `src` directory. For example, `@/assets/img/og-image.png` refers to the `src/assets/img/og-image.png` file.

**The cover image is optional.** If you don't set a cover image, the title and date will be displayed at the top of the page.
