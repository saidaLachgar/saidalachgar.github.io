title: "Mastering Rebase with Git Fork: A Quick Visual Guide"
summary: This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the Git Rebase command using Git Fork, a visual Git client. Rebasing is one of Git’s two key methods for integrating changes between branches, with the other being git merge. While merges create a new commit that ties together branches, rebasing allows you to apply changes from one branch on top of another, effectively rewriting commit history in a cleaner, linear fashion..

## Why Rebase?

Rebasing keeps your commit history clean and linear, making it easier to follow changes. It’s a great way to keep your branch up to date without cluttering the commit log with unnecessary merges.

## Step 1: Switch to Your Feature Branch

Let’s say you're working on a `feature/new-feature` branch and want to rebase it onto the latest `develop` branch.
<Figcaption src={step1} alt="">Select your feature branch from the **Branches** pane and **double-click** to switch to it.</Figcaption>

## Step 2: Start the Rebase

Now it’s time to rebase your feature branch onto `develop` to get the latest changes.

<Figcaption src={step2} alt="">Right-click on the `develop` branch and select **Rebase onto develop**.</Figcaption>

Git Fork will now attempt to apply the commits from your feature branch on top of the latest commits of `develop` branch.

## Step 3: Handle Conflicts (if any)

Sometimes, rebasing can result in conflicts. If this happens:

1. <Figcaption src={step3} alt="">Git Fork will notify you of any conflicts.</Figcaption>
2. <Figcaption src={step4} alt="">Click on resolve</Figcaption>, <Figcaption src={step5} alt="">so you can resolve conflicts by selecting which changes to keep.<br /> &nbsp;you can also keep both changes, or set the final change in the output panel manuly</Figcaption>
3. <Figcaption src={step6} alt="">Once resolved, click **Continue rebase** and continue the rebase process.</Figcaption>


## Step 4: Finalize and Push Changes

After successfully rebasing, you’ll need to push your updated branch to the remote repository.

1. <Figcaption src={step7} alt="">Click the **Push** button at the top.</Figcaption>
2. <Figcaption src={step8} alt="">You will need to check the option to **force push** since the branch’s history has been rewritten during the rebase.</Figcaption>

**Done!**

And that’s it—you’ve just successfully rebased a branch using **Git Fork** without touching the terminal. Now your feature branch is in sync with `develop`, and the commit history looks clean and organized!
