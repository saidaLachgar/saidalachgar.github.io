title: "Mastering Rebase with Git Fork: A Quick Visual Guide"
summary: This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the Git Rebase command using Git Fork, a visual Git client. Rebasing is one of Git’s two key methods for integrating changes between branches, with the other being git merge. While merges create a new commit that ties together branches, rebasing allows you to apply changes from one branch on top of another, effectively rewriting commit history in a cleaner, linear fashion..

### Why Rebase?

Rebasing keeps your commit history clean and linear, making it easier to follow changes. It’s a great way to keep your branch up to date without cluttering the commit log with unnecessary merges.

## Step 1: Switch to Your Feature Branch

Let’s say you're working on a feature branch and want to rebase it onto the latest `develop` branch.

1. In **Git Fork**, select your feature branch from the **Branches** pane.
2. Double-click to switch to it.

For example:
- You are on `feature/new-feature`.

## Step 2: Start the Rebase

Now it’s time to rebase your feature branch onto `develop` to get the latest changes.

1. Right-click on the `develop` branch.
2. Select **Rebase onto develop**.

Git Fork will now attempt to apply the commits from your feature branch on top of the latest `develop` branch.

## Step 3: Handle Conflicts (if any)

Sometimes, rebasing can result in conflicts. If this happens:

1. Git Fork will notify you of any conflicts.
2. Open the **Conflicts** tab, where you can resolve them by selecting which changes to keep.
3. Once resolved, click **Mark as Resolved** and continue the rebase process.

Git Fork makes conflict resolution easy with a clear interface.

## Step 4: Finalize and Push Changes

After successfully rebasing, you’ll need to push your updated branch to the remote repository.

1. Click the **Push** button at the top.
2. You may need to check the option to **force push** since the branch’s history has been rewritten during the rebase.

**Done!**

And that’s it—you’ve just successfully rebased a branch using **Git Fork** without touching the terminal. Now your feature branch is in sync with `develop`, and the commit history looks clean and organized!
