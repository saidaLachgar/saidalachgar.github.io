am a web frontend developer and am making my own portfolio, so in my project section i have to tell 3 challenges and 3 solutions. as a bullet list which means just a vary small sentence. can you help me with that? for example my first project is laboratoires-biarritz.com "it's a Prestashop website, i have made a fully customized frontend ui. where i have also made a custom plugin using php and javascript, it's a live cart overview over the website, the website was fully editable by none developers. where i have use creative elements plugin."

in every website, there are many challenges, you can alway tell me some challenges from your mind based on technologies, i used in the webiste and am gonna choose which ones i want. it's not necessary to extract infos from my small description of the project. you could consider some global Challenges that developer have with the technologie it self.

here is an example of what i wanted from the PrestaShop laboratoires-biarritz.com website
challenges: [
"Customizing checkout process to improve user experience",
"Integrating third-party modules with custom frontend",
"Maintaining SEO best practices with dynamic content",
],
solutions: [
"Ensuring smooth integration of the custom live cart plugin",
"Achieving full customization of the frontend UI while maintaining performance",
"Making the website fully editable by non-developers",
],
and here is another project example it's sysglad-hta.site, it's an angular and symfony website, i also used Api platform, it is an Electric Power Quality Monitoring System, facilitating the tracking and management of electricity production, transmission, and distribution. It employs an algorithm for anomaly detection and network performance analysis.
so the out put was
description: 'Electric Power Quality Monitoring System, facilitating the tracking and management of electricity production, transmission, and distribution. It employs an algorithm for anomaly detection and network performance analysis.',
challenges: [
'Designing a database schema to accurately represent the electricity distribution network',
'Migrating client data from Excel sheets to an SQL database',
'Integrating Angular frontend with Symfony backend',
],
solutions: [
'Integrating the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm',
'Implementing efficient caching strategies',
'Using Angular\'s powerful data-binding and visualization libraries for clear, interactive dashboards',
]

Here is another example, it's a React and symfony project works with big data for big business of social housing, it predicts when an invoice will be paid and automates its collection. it algorithm powered by machine learning predict delays of payment and adapt the dunning plans. it collect information directly from any erp or simply by email. it automate the dunning process, from sending e-invoices to banking reconciliation. it open architecture allows implementation of any financial services to accelerate the whole process. my collaboration in this project was frontend only, where me and two other developer have migrated the website from v1 to v2 by changing all endpoint of the app to work on api platforom and also to upgrade al frontend packages, and centralize and uniformize the projects architecture. it was my first time to work on big project where i have to deal with 2 other frontend developer and 4 backend ones from different countries we worked with the scrum methodology with a french product owner, i hade to follow many methodologies, like git-flow and many other ones for the code structure. after we have migrated the app from v1 to v2, i have kept working on the project as the ony frontend developer by adding new features, it was an amazing journey.
the output is

description: 'An application focused on big data solutions for social housing. It uses machine learning to predict invoice payment timelines, automates collection processes, integrates with ERPs, and supports various financial services through an open architecture.',
challenges: [
'Coordinating frontend changes with backend updates during the migration from v1 to v2',
'Maintaining consistent UI/UX across a large-scale application with diverse feature sets',
'Adapting to and implementing SCRUM methodologies alongside remote international team members',
],
solutions: [
'Collaborating with backend developers to synchronize API changes with frontend updates',
'Utilizing Git-flow for efficient version control and collaborative development',
'Conducting regular code reviews and using standardized coding practices to maintain code quality',
],

Now your turn, your first project is hifi-filter.com, in this website i have only worked on the backend where front end was made by some very creative developers so i only had to make every part of it dynamic using wordpress, it was a very challenging website since everything on it has a special design, i have used wordpress's ACF plugin, where every block in the website has been developed as a component where the user can select in the wordpress's gutenberg editor. also the website has a very interesting menu with images and icons with many levels where i had to make a very custom menu walker for it. i also worked on the SEO part, especially for images, since the website has tones of images.
